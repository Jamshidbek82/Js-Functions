#What is a function in Javascript?
#What types of functions are there in Javascript?

Functions are used in order to implement certain events and cases. 
Functions can be performed in two ways. One is to make it implement when some changes are made ( like clicking a button, entering input data etc.. ).
Another is to make it automatically perform when the page is fully  loaded.

There two kinds of functions in Javascript:
  1. Void funtions
  2. Unvoid funtions

Example for function:

  function sayHi() {
    alert("Hello Everyone!");
  }
  
  sayHi();
